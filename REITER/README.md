# The REITER Algorithm in Continuous Time

These are programs for solving Krusell-Smith model in continuous time by the REITER algorithm as described in

* Masakazu Emoto and Takeki Sunakawa (2021) "Applying the Explicit Aggregation Algorithm to Heterogeneous Agent Models in Continuous Time," avaialble at https://tkksnk.github.io/wps/

  * The original code is downloaded from https://github.com/gregkaplan/phact

* NOTE: We modify the original simulate.m in the phact toolbox to calculate the Den Haan Errors.
