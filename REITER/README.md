# The REITER Algorithm in Continuous Time

These are programs for solving Krusell-Smith model in continuous time by the REITER algorithm as described in

* Masakazu Emoto and Takeki Sunakawa (2021) "Applying the Explicit Aggregation Algorithm to Heterogeneous Agent Models in Continuous Time," which is avaialble at https://tkksnk.github.io/wps/

* Reference :
  * Ahn, S., G. Kaplan, B. Moll, T. Winberry and C. Wolf (2018, NBER Macroeconomics Annual 32.1, 1-75) "When inequality matters for macro and macro matters for inequality"
  * The original code is downloaded from https://github.com/gregkaplan/phact

* NOTE: We modify the original simulate.m in the phact toolbox to calculate the Den Haan Errors.

For questions about the programs, please send an email to: Masakazu Emoto <masakazu.emoto@gmail.com>
