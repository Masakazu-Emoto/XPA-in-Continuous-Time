# Krusell-Smith (KS) Algorithm in Continuous Time

These are programs for solving the Krusell-Smith model in continuous time by the Krusell-Smith (KS) algorithm as described in

* Masakazu Emoto and Takeki Sunakawa (2021) "Applying the Explicit Aggregation Algorithm to Heterogeneous Agent Models in Continuous Time," which is avaialble at https://tkksnk.github.io/wps/

* Reference :
  * Fernandez-Villaverde, J., S. Hurtado and G. Nuno (2019) "Solving the Krusell-Smith (1998) model" "Financial Frictions and the Wealth Distribution"
  * The original code is downloaded from https://github.com/jesusfv/financial-frictions/tree/master/KS_LR

* To run the main program with the baseline parameters in `common/parameter.m` and see some results, run `main_KS_v1.m` with `diagnose = 1;` and `loadtemp = 0;`

For questions about the programs, please send an email to: Masakazu Emoto <masakazu.emoto@gmail.com>
