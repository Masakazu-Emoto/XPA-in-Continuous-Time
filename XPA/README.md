# XPA Algorithm in Continuous Time

These are programs for solving Krusell-Smith model in continuous time by the XPA algorithm as described in

  * The original code is downloaded from https://github.com/jesusfv/financial-frictions/tree/master/KS_LR and https://github.com/tkksnk/Xpa

* To run the main program with the baseline parameters in `common/parameter.m`, run `main_XPA_v1.m` with `diagnose = 1;` and `loadtemp = 0;`
